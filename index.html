                    I've been working in the Video game industry for 13 years now in various roles.
                    I'm married to my phenomenal wife, Alice, and we have one loud screaming demon (cat) named Wednesday.
                    I've been feeling listless and bored at work so I decided to join this boot camp to increase my skills and manuever better in my life.
                    I'm definitely going to have more games here in the future.
